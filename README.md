# Mixed Reality Extension SDK Samples

The Mixed Reality Extension SDK Samples is the easiest way to build and run 
your first [AltspaceVR](https://altvr.com/) extension using the [Mixed Reality Extension SDK](
https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk). 

## Prerequisites
* Install [Node.js 8.12](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.12.0/) or 
newer, which includes NPM 6.4.1 or newer, from nodejs.org

## How to Build and Run the Hello World sample
From command prompt:
* `git clone http://github.com/microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk-samples`
* `cd mixed-reality-extension-sdk-samples\samples\hello-world`
* `npm install` This will install all dependent packages. (and will do very
little if there are no changes)
* `npm run build` This should not report any errors.
* `npm start` This should print "INF: Multi-peer Adapter listening on..."

In AltspaceVR
* Go to your personal home
* Make sure you are signed in properly, not a guest
* Activate the Space Editor
* Click Basics group
* Click on SDKApp
* For the URL field, enter `ws://localhost:3901`
* Click Confirm

You should now see the words "Hello World". Congratulations, you have now 
deployed a Node.js server with the MRE SDK onto your local machine and 
connected to it from AltspaceVR.

### Hosting in the Cloud
In order for other AltspaceVR users to see your SDK app running, it must be hosted in a way they can connect to it. To learn about cloud hosting and other solutions, checkout [DEPLOYING.md](https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk/blob/master/DEPLOYING.md) in the SDK repo.

To learn more about the SDK, please read the [MRE SDK readme](
https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk/blob/master/README.md).

## Sample Descriptions
* Hello World - shows a text that animates when highlighting or clicking on a
cube
* Solar System - loads a 3d model for each planet, generates keyframe
animations, and when all assets are ready, start all animations simultaneously.
